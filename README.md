_This was created for use on my forever world, called "derex smp". Check it out in action, server ip: `mc.longhorns.dev`_

Configurable plugin that plays an animation when the night is skipped, so if you look at the night sky, you can see it slowly turning to day!

Designed to be simple, server-friendly and immersive.

This was created for use on my forever world, called "derex smp", and now I am sharing it with the world. The server is named after the COVID-era derex smp [sic], a Minecraft survival multiplayer server that ran from summer 2020 to early 2022, filled with lore, drama, and memories.
